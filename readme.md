## Caw Full-Stack Application

Caw is a friendly user interface for the Watson Personality Insight AI. Basically, this AI takes in a portion of text containing more than 100 words and preferably over 1,200 words. With this, the AI provides some data about the author's personality traits. Caw allows users to either plug in their text without logging in, or to create an account so that searches and results can be saved for future reference.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using React.js, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4, HTML and CSS, React Router for directing the proper components to their URLs, npm packages email-regex (for checking that a field contains input matching the format of a standard email address) and personality-sunburst-chart (which handles the graphical representation of the data), Express for the server, MySQL for the database, Sequelize to create the database models and ORM structure, and axios for front-end requests to the back-end.
